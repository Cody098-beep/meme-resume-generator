      We need unnecessary lore, mock seriousness, and weird confessions that make people think,<br>
      <span class="text-yellow-300">“I don’t know if this person’s a genius or just hasn’t slept in three days.”</span>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Although there's nothing crazy about me but here's a little description about me:
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      So Hey, Everybody <span class="italic text-gray-300">(with little awkwardness)</span> I’m the human disaster behind this website.

    </p>

    <blockquote class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-4">
      “What if this had more Shrek?”
    </blockquote>

      This all started when I was applying for jobs and realized my resume was so dry it could be used as kindling.
      I needed spice. I needed chaos. I needed something that would make a recruiter laugh so hard it Seemed like they had inhaled laughing gas.<br>
      And thus, <span class="font-bold text-blue-300">Meme Resume Generator</span> was born.
